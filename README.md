# My Portfolio

A portfolio page with some information about me, my resumé, and links to some of my GitHub repositories.
This portfolio is a React-based implementation, though front-end only.

## Description

This portfolio is implemented using React and, specifically react-dom-router which has eased the task of providing stylistic consistency across multiple pages.

Sample of the four screens accessible via the portfolio URL follow:

![Resumé page](screens/screen4.png)

Special thanks to the teaching staff of the University of Pennsylvania Full Stack Coding Boot Camp (UPENN-VIRT-FSF-FT-07-2023-U-LOLC-M-F).

The class training materials and associated repository, especially activities in unit 20 were consulted extensively.

In addition, extensive use was made of the admirably thorough and lucid [React documentation](https://react.dev/learn).

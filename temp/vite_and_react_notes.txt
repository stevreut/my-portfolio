Vite/React:
    Getting started:
        FIRST - cd to repos (not repo name folder whether pre-existing or not)
        npm create vite@latest
        select a project name of your choice (overlay 'vite-project')
            (I used "my-portfolio" to match repo name)
        Arrow down to select "React" from rainbow-color list
        Arrow down to select "JavaScript" from the four options displayed in blue and yellow

        (If repo was pre-created then you will have no choice but to opt for deletion of previous
        repo contents.  In which case (hopefully) they can be restored from github(?).)

        You will then be instructed as follows:

            Done. Now run:

                cd my-portfolio
                npm install
                npm run dev

        The last command should cause a skeleton REACT app to run in the localhost and the
        URL for accessing will appear.  Bring up in live server to confirm.
